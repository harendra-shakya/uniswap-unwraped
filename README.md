I was understanding how uniswap works so I made some notes with that so others can also understand. This repo contains uniswap code and tons of notes and resources with that to understand how uniswap works.

Repo contains 3 Folders

- [Uniswap v2](uniswap-v2) - this is the main repo, here you will find explanation of uniswap v2 line by line. Just go inside the contracts e.g. [UniswapV2Pair](uniswap-v2/v2-core/UniswapV2Pair.sol) and you will find explaination inside that.

- [Uniswap v3](uniswap-v3) - contains explaination how uniswap v3 works

- [Curve](curve) - contains explaination how curve works


If you have any doubt or find any mistake, please feel free to reach out to me and Iâ€™d try to reply AFAP. [Contact Me](https://linktr.ee/harendra_shakya)
